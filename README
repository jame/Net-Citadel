Net-Citadel
===========

This package is a first cut on supporting the Citadel application
protocol as defined in

  http://www.citadel.org/doku.php/documentation:appproto:app_proto

At this stage the package supports only some basic functionality, but
more can be added easily. Also the API is only a first (quick)
shot. Of course, you can make it a bit more 'computer sciency'.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

# NOTE: Since I cannot rely on a Citadel installation to exist, the test
# will silently (and successfully) terminate if no connection to a Citadel
# server can be made. See test.yaml for configuration options and rerun
# the test(s).
