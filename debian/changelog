libnet-citadel-perl (0.02-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO:
  [as a general note, the package looks very good, this is just nitpicking on
  minor details]
  - I'd remove debian/libnet-citadel-perl.docs, the README is not really
    helpful for users and we usual don't install those boilerplate READMEs
  - d/control:
    + libconfig-yaml-perl doesn't need a version, even oldstable has the
      required one
    + please mention the module name somewhere in the long description,
      eg. s|This package|Net::Citadel| (makes searching easier)
  - d/copyright:
    + we usually do s|Debian GNU/Linux|Debian|, since there's also a freebsd
      kernel nowadays
    + the comment under "Artistic or GPL-1+" for Files:* is not necessary (but
      it's of course not wrong)
  - .gitignore: not sure if this is a good idea, 1) it might clash with a
    potential future upstream .gitignore, and 2) it might hide problems
    (leftovers after builds)

  * Initial Release. (Closes: #649410)
