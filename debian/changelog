libnet-citadel-perl (0.02-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO:
  - debian/copyright:
    + "Format-Specification" is now standardized; update it.
    + Update "Maintainer" to be myself when packaging next upstream.
    + Add myself to 'Files: *' copyright when packaging next upstream.
    + Add 2012 to my 'Files: debian/*' copyright.
  - debian/control:
    + Update Standards-Version to current (3.9.3?).
  - Update for new upstream when that is available.
    + Since that should include a fix for the doc patch;  remove that.
