libnet-citadel-perl (0.16-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO:
  - packages doesn't build; error in test due to missing build dependency:
    "Error:  Can't locate Readonly.pm in @INC"
    probably also missing in Depends
    (haven't look further besides trying to see if our META.yml-stops-build
    problem is fixed which it is :))

  * New upstream release.
  * Updated the Standards-Version to 3.9.4 in debian/control.
  * Changes to debian/copyright:
    - Update the copyright years for the debian/* files.
    - Correct 'Name' as 'Upstream-Name' in the header stanza.
    - Update the listed copyright holders in the 'Files: *' section.
    - Add a separate stanza for the new lib/Net/Citadel/ToDo.pod file.
    - Update 'Maintainer' as 'Upstream-Contact' and update who that is.
    - Correct the Format line in the header stanza to indicate version v1.0.
  * Remove debian/patches/echo-function-doc.patch as it is no longer needed.
