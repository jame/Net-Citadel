=head1 NAME

Net::Citadel::ToDo - To Do items for the Net::Citadel Perl extension.


=head1 TODO

=head2 General

Add a function for the MRTG command, possibly as the function C<citadel_mrtg>.

Add a function for the INFO command, possibly as the function C<citadel_info>.

Add a ZIPFLAGS configuration item for dist/zipdist in Makefile.PL?

Add a note in the documentation about the Net::Citadel repository and home page
at GitHub? Also include a reference to where it is available at the C<gitpan>
CPAN mirror at GitHub?


=head2 Constants

There are some numbers being used that are actually constants; change to
using Readonly to define them for use in the code, unless there are other
standard constants that can be used, like those for the flock operations.

Add a paragraph to the documentation after the CONSTANTS header.

Add a paragraph to the documentation after the 'Results Code' header, perhaps
including a link to the online status codes page in Citadel Documentation.

Add a paragraph to the documentation after the 'Room Access' header, perhaps
including a link to the online page in Citadel Documentation that refers to
them.

A "000" string constant is used quite often by Citadel but is not defined in the
module.

There is a set of follow up reply codes noted in the documentation that are not
yet in the module.

A C<NO_SUCH_USER> return code is mentioned in the command documentation (for
the USER command, for instance,) but the module doesn't currently appear to
define it.

Add a link to the online documentation for the status codes:
http://www.citadel.org/doku.php?id=documentation:appproto:statuscodes


=head2 Functions

There does not seem to an explicit function to close the connection; i.e., close
the socket being used to communicate with the server.

=item C<assert_room> function

Is the C<assert_room> command coming up with the correct floor information?

Is the C<assert_room> function sending the parameters for the CRE8 command
properly? (There is a note in the code indicating an uncertainty about what
should be sent.)


=item C<retract_room> function

In the existing test code for the C<retract_floor> function, there is a comment
saying C<CITADEL BUG>; investigate if it an issue with the function itself, an
actual issue with Citadel, and/or just something to do with the test script.
The documentation for the function itself refers back to Citadel v7.20, so there
may not be any issue with it now.


=item function C<new>

The line just before the 'return $self' line actually has two commands on it,
not just one. The second one is just "<$s>;" and that has the comment
"# consume banner".  That 'banner' is something like the following:
 "200 <systen name> Citadel server ready."  Instead of not doing anything
with that, save it somewhere? At least the <system name> part of it?  (The
first command on that line just establishes the $s variable for that read.)
At least, put them on separate lines.


=item C<citadel_time> function

The current C<citadel_time> function only returns the first two parameters
from the TIME command:  C<1347624956|-14400>.  The Citadel TIME command itself
actually returns a line like this: C<200 1347625545|-14400|1|1347537300>,
with the '200' being the OK code and the rest being the four fields that it
returns (which also needs to be documented). So as currently written, the
function doesn't return the daylight savings time indication and the actual
citadel server start information. Function first needs to be changed to at
least return all parameters.

Rewrite the C<citadel_time> function to unpack the parameters that the
TIME command returns when it is successful, and then return them to
the calling program in a hash? Could also then return the hash with a 
key named 'error' or 'Error' if it is not successful. Update its POD
to reflect the changes.


=item C<citadel_echo> function

It appears to test if what was sent was actually received back but only returns
true if it doesn't fail because there is no match. Add an explicit return of
the value returned from the ECHO command? 

=back


=head2 Documentation

Add something like Net::Citadel::Tutorial for examples of the use and configuration
of the module.


=head2 Testing

Change the names of the test floors and rooms to something like C<Test Floor>
and C<Test Room>?

In the testing related to users, change to using the name TestUser.

Update the testing for the C<citadel_time> function to at least check the
number of parameters returned? Three of the parameters are Unix timestamps;
validate those in some way? The other parameter being returned is a Boolean
and is used to indicate Daylight Savings Time and should be a '0' or a '1'.

When testing for a floor, it looks for C<Main Floor>; that exists on
a default install but may not be on an working system. Make it another
configuration item, which if not configured would default to C<Main Floor>?

Separate the testing to: functions that do not require a log in, those that do
require a log in, those that are read only, those that write to the server. Or
use the separation given in the documentation for the different Sections for
the commands?

Since Config::YAML is already a build-depends and is used by the main test
script, add a C<Testing> section of some sort to the test.yaml file and check
that for the various options for testing instead of just attempting to reach a
Citadel server?

Instead of having the debugging 'warning' lines commented out, use a DEBUG
environment variable and/or a test.yaml configuration item for it. Same
for the 'use Data::Dumper' line itself.

Use Config::YAML::Tiny instead of Config::YAML? (Does not appear to be in
Debian as yet, although YAML::Tiny is.)

Use something like Test::MockObject to do at least basic testing of the 
various functions.  And/or Test::TCP?
