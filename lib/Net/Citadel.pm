=head1 NAME

Net::Citadel - Citadel.org protocol coverage

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.13

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.13';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Citadel;
  my $c = new Net::Citadel (host => 'citadel.example.org');
  $c->login ('Administrator', 'goodpassword');
  my @floors = $c->floors;

  eval {
     $c->assert_floor ('Level 6 (Management)');
  }; warn $@ if $@;

  $c->retract_floor ('Level 6 (Management)');

  $c->logout;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Citadel is a "turnkey open-source solution for email and collaboration" (this is as far as marketing
can go :-). The main component is the I<citadel server>. To communicate with it you can use either
a web interface, or - if you have to automate things - with a protocol

   L<http://www.citadel.org/doku.php?id=documentation:appproto:start>

This package tries to do a bit of abstraction (more could be done) and handles some of the protocol
handling.  The basic idea is that the application using the package deals with Citadel's objects:
rooms, floors, users.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Constructor

The constructor creates a handle to the citadel server (and creates the TCP connection). It expects
the following named parameters:

=over

=item I<host> (default: C<localhost>)

The hostname (or IP address) where the citadel server is running on. Defaults to C<localhost>.

=item I<port> (default: C<$CITADEL_PORT>)

The port there.

=back

The constructor will croak if no connection can be established.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = bless { @_ }, $class;
    $self->{host} ||= 'localhost';
    $self->{port} ||= $CITADEL_PORT;
    use IO::Socket::INET;
    $self->{socket} = IO::Socket::INET->new (PeerAddr => $self->{host},
					     PeerPort => $self->{port},
					     Proto    => 'tcp',
					     Type     => SOCK_STREAM) or croak "cannot connect to $self->{host}:$self->{port} ($@)";
    my $s = $self->{socket}; <$s>; # consume banner
    return $self;
}

=pod

=head2 Methods

=head3 Authentication

=over

=item I<login>

I<$c>->login (I<$user>, I<$pwd>)

Logs in this user, or will croak if that fails.

=cut

sub login {

I<$c>->logout

Well, logs out the current user.

=cut

    my $s    = $self->{socket};

    print $s "LOUT\n";
    <$s> =~ /(\d).. (.*)/ and ($1 == 2 or croak $2);
}

=pod

=back

=head3 Floors

=over

=item I<floors>

I<@floors> = I<$c>->floors

Retrieves a list (ARRAY) of known floors. Each entry is a hash reference with the name, the number
of rooms in that floor and the index as ID. The index within the array is also the ID of the floor.

=cut

sub floors {
    my $self = shift;
    my $s    = $self->{socket};

    print $s "LFLR\n";
    <$s> =~ /(\d).. (.*)/ and ($1 == 1 or croak $2);

    }

#100 Known floors:
#0|Main Floor|33
#1|SecondLevel|1
#000
}

=pod

=item I<assert_floor>

I<$c>->assert_floor (I<$floor_name>)

Creates the floor with the name provided, or if it already exists simply returns. This only croaks if
there are insufficient privileges.

=cut

    my $name = shift;

    my $s    = $self->{socket};

#CFLR XXX|1
#550 This command requires Aide access.
}

=pod

=item I<retract_floor>

I<$c>->retract_floor (I<$floor_name>)

Retracts a floor with this name. croaks if that fails because of insufficient privileges. Does
not croak if the floor did not exist.

B<NOTE>: Citadel server (v7.20) seems to have the bug that you cannot
delete an empty floor without restarting the server. Not much I can do
here about that.
